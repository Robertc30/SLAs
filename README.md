# Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Welcome to the realm of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), where precision meets commitment, and excellence is the standard. In the dynamic landscape of customer support, SLAs serve as the cornerstone, outlining the benchmarks and expectations that drive operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.


## Defining Priority Levels

At the heart of every SLA lies the concept of priority levels—a mechanism for categorizing and prioritizing support requests based on their urgency and impact. Whether it's a critical system outage or a minor inquiry, osTicket empowers you to define and customize priority levels tailored to your organization's needs.

Through intuitive interfaces, you can assign specific response and resolution times to each priority level, ensuring that critical issues receive prompt attention while maintaining efficiency across the board. With osTicket's flexible framework, the power to fine-tune priority levels lies at your fingertips, allowing you to strike the perfect balance between responsiveness and resource allocation.

## Grace Periods and Escalation Policies

In the realm of SLAs, time is of the essence. However, we understand that circumstances may arise, causing deviations from predefined timelines. That's where grace periods come into play—a buffer zone that accommodates unforeseen delays while maintaining accountability and transparency.

With osTicket's robust escalation policies, you can configure automated workflows to trigger alerts and notifications when SLA deadlines approach or breaches occur. By establishing clear escalation paths and thresholds, you ensure that no support request slips through the cracks, and customer expectations are consistently met, if not exceeded.
